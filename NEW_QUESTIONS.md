1. Imagine you have a binary tree with nodes that also have a "next" value. Write a function that properly connects all nodes on the same level with the first available sibling on the right, if it exists.
2. Imagine that you have a bunch of algebraic relationships, e.g. `A/B = 7.5`, `B/C = 2.0`. Write a function that takes in these relationships and a new relationship, e.g. `A/C`, and returns the value of the new relationship , e.g. `3.75`.
